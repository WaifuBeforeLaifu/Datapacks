# V1.1
- Made the yeeters naturally spawn
- Added a custom loot table

# V1.2
- Yeeters now respect the mob griefing gamerule

# V1.3
- Added PersistanceRequired tag to mob to prevent parts from despawning
- Fixed a bug where the parts would be left even when the base mob despawned
- Removed the capitalization in the fake loot tables to hopefully make the datapack 1.15 compatible, but I cannot guarantee it will work in 1.15. Open an issue **when the update is fully released** if the datapack seems broken

# V2.0
- Updated to 1.15 Pre-4. Unless something changes this should be compatible with the full release of 1.15
- Removed spawn egg crafting
- Yeeters now always naturally spawn
- Rewrote most of the functions to make it more efficient
- Fixed an issue where the yeeter would die if the head got pushed into a wall
- Yeeters can now spawn anywhere instead of just on the surface

# V2.1
- Forgot to add a scoreboard objective in load.mcfunction

# V2.2
- Added absorbtion health
- Explosions now always use creepers to add scaling damage
- Added tags used by my other datapacks to the creepers
