# V1.1
- Made the yeeters naturally spawn
- Added a custom loot table

# V1.2
- Yeeters now respect the mob griefing gamerule

# V1.3
- Added PersistanceRequired tag to mob to prevent parts from despawning
- Fixed a bug where the parts would be left even when the base mob despawned
- Removed the capitalization in the fake loot tables to hopefully make the datapack 1.15 compatible, but I cannot guarantee it will work in 1.15. Open an issue **when the update is fully released** if the datapack seems broken.
