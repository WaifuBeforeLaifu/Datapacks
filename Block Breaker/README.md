Recommended Version: 1.15

Newest Verion: [Block Breaker V1.1](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/raw/master/Block%20Breaker/Block%20Break%20V1.1.zip)

Drop a diamond pickaxe ontop of a dropper to create the block breaker. Power the dropper to break block adjacent to the dropper in the direction it is facing. The dropper will still function as a regular dropper.
