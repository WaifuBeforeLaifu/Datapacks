# V1.1
- Fixed the spawn command to have the husk's loot table set to "null" instead of "NULL". For some reason having the loot table in caps was causing it not to spawn in some versions.

# V1.2
- Yeah apparently I'm dumb and forgot to add in the natural spawning feature

# V1.3
- Added randomly enchanted iron boots to the loot table

# V1.4
- Updated loot tables to be compatible with spigot/papermc
