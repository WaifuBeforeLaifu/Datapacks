# Better Dispensers
Recommended Version: 1.14.4

Newest Verion: [Better Dispensers V1.1](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/raw/master/Better%20Dispensers/Better%20Dispensers%20V1.1.zip)

Drop 1 gold ingot ontop of a dispenser to upgrade it. Upgraded dispensers are capable of placing sand, gravel, and concrete powder instead of dropping the item.

## Known bugs
- Block may sometimes be generated on the wrong space. Restrict the area the dispenser fires into to avoid this.
- Nearby dropped sand/gravel/concrete may be turned into a block instead of the item fired from the dispenser. 
- Very fast clocks will not work with the dispenser.
- If you are too close to the front of the dispenser you will pick up the item before it turns into a solid block.
