# V0.1
- Will not auto target anything yet. Add the tag "thostile" to things you want to target when using this version.
- WIll always drop a turret spawn egg when killed and will not drop emeralds used to upgrade. Will fix with loot tables later.
- Only 2 tiers for upgrading and will only upgrade the fire rate. Will add customizations such as different higher damage and different projectile types later.
- Upgrade items don't get cleared from your inventory

# V0.11
- Now auto targets all naturally hostile mobs. Does not target neutral mobs or players unless the tag "thostile" is manually added to them. 

# V1.0
- Upgrade items are now cleared from players' inventories.
- Turrets only drop the spawn egg when destroyed by players.
- Different projectiles are planned to maybe be added in a later update
