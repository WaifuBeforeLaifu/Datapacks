Recommended Version: 1.14.4

Newest Verion: [Corvo's Blink V1.2](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/blob/master/Corvo's%20Blink/Corvo's%20Blink%20V1.2.zip)

Use the blink ability from Dishonored 1&2. To get the item use "/function cblink:get". Requires ender pearls to teleport. The datapack is somewhat multiplayer compatible, If you throw or activate the rod too close to another player/bobber then it may not function properly.
