Newest Verion: [Corvo's Blink V1](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/raw/master/Corvo's%20Blink/Corvo's%20Blink%20V1.zip)

Use the blink ability from Dishonored 1&2. To get the item use "/function cblink:get". Requires ender pearls to teleport. I'm pretty sure this is multiplayer compatible but I need to do more testing before I can say for certain.
