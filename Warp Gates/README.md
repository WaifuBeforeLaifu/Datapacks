Craft a set of warp gates using the recipe listed below and place them in item frames at eye level on a wall. Right click while standing on any type of pressure plate to warp to the corresponding warp gate. Warp gates work over any distance. Only the Blue panes are done, I will add the other 15 colors later on.
