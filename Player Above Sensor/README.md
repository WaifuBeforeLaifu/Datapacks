# Player Above Sensor
Recommended Version: 1.15.2

Newest Verion: [Player Above Sensor V1.0](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/raw/master/Player%20Above%20Sensor/Player%20Above%20Sensor%20V1.0.zip)

Outputs redstone pulses if a player enters/exits a 5x5.25x5 cube above the sensor. Drop a daylight detector onto a golden block to create one. There **must** be an empty block below the gold block to create one or for an already created one to function. Break the gold block to remove the sensor. Works pretty similar to the [player above sensor](https://terraria.gamepedia.com/Sensors) from Terraria.

## Known Issues
- If a player logs off while in the box, it will output an additional pulse when they log back on. This can make machines go into an inverted state. Pretty sure this only happens in areas where the chunks are loaded by other players or in single player.
