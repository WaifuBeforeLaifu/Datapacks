# Mini UHC
Recommended Version: 1.14.4

Newest Verion: [Mini UHC V1](https://github.com/WaifuBeforeLaifu/Datapacks/raw/master/Mini%20UHC/Mini%20UHC%20V1.zip)

Create a game by loading this into your world and typing "/function miniuhc:gamesetup" then typing "/function miniuhc:gamestart" to start the game. This datapack will make your world unplayable in normal survival so make sure you only use it in brand new worlds. More info will be listed here once I get more added to the pack.
